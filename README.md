1) An application that allows you to consume and interact properly/fully with your Web API / Service.  You 
may choose the development environment of choice, but you are responsible for its functionality and all 
research involved in making it work properly.  You can choose JS, Blazor, PHP, Python, or another platform 
of choice.  I recommend JS or Blazor, especially if you hit major brick walls and time is limited.  Make sure 
both Good and Bad responses are handled in the App.


2) Create a list of the functions and object classes the App has and make sure there are links in the App.


4) As you connect to each functionality built into the App, test both good and bad situations. As you build 
functionality share:
    a) Text describing the function
    b) show snapshot of the code
    c) show successful and unsuccessful tests look within your App..
